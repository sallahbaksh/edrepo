<h1>EdRepo Installed</h1>
<p>You've installed the EdRepo Frontend!</p>
<p>You can navigate this collection by using the tabs at the top of the page.  To try out submitting and moderating modules, login by clicking the blue button  in the upper-right hand corner of the site. The following demo accounts are set  up for you to try (all with the password "edrepo"):</p>
<ul>
<li>Type: Viewer - Email: viewer@example.com </li>
<li>Type: Submitter - Email: submitter@example.com </li>
<li>Type: Editor - Email: editor@example.com </li>
</ul>

<p>The collection maintainer should replace this page with custom content  for their collection's home page by logging into EdRepo as an Admin and  editing the "Homepage" from the "Information Pages" box on the "Configure  This Collection" panel from within EdRepo. If this install is being used in a production environment,  please remove the demo accounts or at least change the passwords. Otherwise, anyone can access EdRepo.</p>
<p>Please read all documentation found in the documentation folder.</p>
<p>If you have not yet done so, you should visit our <a href="install.php">Installation</a> page and our <a href="installmysql.php">Server Installation</a> page to configure your Edrepo system.</p>
