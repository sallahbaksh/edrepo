<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>This provider doesn't support sets or resumption tokens.  This isn't much of an issue currently, given 
SWEnet's small size.</li>
<li>This provider passes the OAI Repository Explorer's automated compliance tests.  It is compliant with the OAI-PMH 
protocal version 2 at least to the extent tested by the Repository Explorer.</li>
</ul>
